## Note

03/22 : The number of deaths related to COVID-19 is lower than what was announced on March 21, 2020. The test of one of these people was negative.

03/23 : The significant increase in confirmed cases is explained by the fact that on March 22, 2020, cases tested positive by hospital laboratories are now considered confirmed. They no longer need validation by the Laboratoire de santé publique du Québec (LSPQ).

03/26 : The linear increase in recent dates likely attributes to the limited testing conducted per day. - Note by me (not authority)

03/28 : Quebec page stopped releasing recovered data. - Note by me

03/29 : In days that lack recovered cases data, used previous day's count instead. - Note by me

04/10 : Stop updating "[recovered.csv](./recovered.csv)" since no further information has been given on the government site for the past while. - Note by me.

## Future
I'm stopping committing changes as of Apr. 30. I think find the [CTV page](https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/coronavirus/tracking-every-case-of-covid-19-in-canada-1.4852102#quebec) very handy to use. Stay safe, ça va bien aller :D
